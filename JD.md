# Full-Stack Engineer at Periskope

### About Us

At [Periskope](https://periskope.app/), we're building **Superhuman for WhatsApp**. Our multi-number WhatsApp platform helps thousands of clients across 100+ countries manage their operations on WhatsApp at scale.

We're scaling rapidly with **7 figures in ARR**, **20% month-over-month growth**, and are **PAT profitable**. We're on a path to grow 5x this year and are looking for senior full-stack engineers to join us on this journey.

### The Role

As a senior engineer, you will have **end-to-end ownership** of complex modules, manage and scale our infrastructure, interface directly with clients for bugs and new features, and mentor junior engineers.

### What You'll Do

- Roll out **Periskope AI agents** on WhatsApp for clients—including knowledge base support, tool calling, and logging
- Build a complete **usage-based billing system** on Chargebee with multi-entity gateway support
- Refactor our **web/desktop application** on Next.js to improve performance
- Launch **Periskope Mobile** on React Native

### What We're Looking For

- **Sky-high ownership** — We don't have PMs. You'll scope out the work, build it, deploy it, test it, and gather feedback from customers.
- **Proficiency with AI** — especially Claude Code
- **Technical experience** with Next.js (frontend), Node/Express, Postgres (Supabase), Gemini, and GCP
